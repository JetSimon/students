## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-issue) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-issue).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting An Issue

[Search the repo](https://github.com/langaracs/course-resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Issue

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut and if so which one?
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples (_if applicable_). If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

### Suggesting Enhancements

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

[Search the repo](https://github.com/langaracs/course-resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets (_if applicable_) which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** (_if applicable_) which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of REPL which the suggestion is related to.
